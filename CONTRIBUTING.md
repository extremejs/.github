# Contributing to ExtremeJS

We love your input! We want to make contributing to our projects as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use GitHub Flow[^GITHUB_FLOW_GUIDE], So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use GitHub Flow[^GITHUB_FLOW_GUIDE]. We actively
welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the
same MIT License[^MIT_LICENSE] that covers the project. Feel free to contact the
maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report.
Here's [another example](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We follow [this config](https://github.com/ardalanamini/eslint-config-noir).

You can try running `pnpm lint` for style unification.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under our project's MIT License.
